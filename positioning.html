        Can you hear it? The song of bell
    Heals me like when I see the shining stars
    Can you feel it? Just take a breath
    On this stage our breath will be the breeze
    On and on, rings in my ears
    I can’t stop thinking about you anymore 
    So special, brand new day by day
    My days are just for you
    Target
    Everyday Everywhere
    Your voice
    Coming to me Rushing to me
    Fill me up with your wish and 
    Make Me Smile
    Highway
    Can’t you see it?
    We only shine in the story of us 
    So marvelous
    Take me to paradise and
    Make Me Smile
    Ring of light every night
    Will you be my lullaby?
    Get, set, Target on
    When I look behind
    You are
    Always with me
    Yes, you are
    </p>
    <p>
    Can you find it? The missing light
    You are the only one who saves the night
    What if everyday,
    Always overlayed,
    Shaded gray? 
    What if all the stars
    Faded with the day?
    They will shine on brighter
    Day by day
    When I think I’m alone
    I still feel like you’re always behind me
    Finally, it’s about time
    There is something to tell you
    Will You hear me out?
    Looking for a long time but today here we are
    Are you ready? Because I,
    I will give it all for you
    Target
    Everyday Everywhere
    Your voice
    Coming to me Rushing to me
    Fill me up with your wish and 
    Make Me Smile
    Highway
    Can’t you see it?
    We only shine in the story of us 
    So marvelous
    Take me to paradise and
    Make Me Smile
    Ring of light every night
    Will you be my lullaby?
    Get, set, Target on
    When I look behind
    You are
    Always with me
